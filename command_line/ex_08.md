## Assignment: Process Management and Termination

### Task:

- List all currently running processes using the ps command. Try using different options like -aux to view detailed information.
- Identify a process that is not critical and can be safely terminated (e.g., a text editor like nano or gedit).
- Use the kill command to terminate the identified process using its PID (Process ID).
- If the process does not terminate with the standard kill command, use kill -9 followed by the PID to force termination.
- Verify that the process has been terminated by listing all processes again.

üí° Are you familiar with the differences between kill, kill -9, and other signals like SIGTERM and SIGKILL? Understanding these can be crucial for proper system management.

### Extra Challenge

#### Challenge 1:
Write a script that monitors a specific process by name and automatically restarts it if it crashes or is terminated.

#### Challenge 2:
Modify the script to log each restart event with the date and time to a log file.

üîç Do you need guidance on how to write bash scripts or how to implement process checks in a script? This could be a great way to automate some aspects of system administration.
