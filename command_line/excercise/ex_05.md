## Assignment: Using SCP and Rsync

### Task:

- Use `scp` to copy a file called `sample.txt` from your local machine to a remote server.
- Modify `sample.txt` on your local machine, then use `rsync` to synchronize the changes with the version on the remote server.
- Use `rsync` with the `--dry-run` option to preview what changes will be applied before performing the actual synchronization.
